# Agents

Perry workspaces come with AI coding tools pre-installed and can sync credentials and configs from the host.

## Run agents inside a workspace

```bash
perry shell myproject
claude
opencode
codex
```

## What gets synced

- Agent credentials and configs from the host
- `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/` if present
- OpenCode config plus `auth.json` and any MCP server settings

Sync happens on workspace start and when you run `perry sync`.

## Sessions in the Web UI

The Sessions tab is a history and shortcut list. Opening a session drops you into a terminal in that workspace.

## Workflows

- [OpenCode Workflow](./workflows/opencode.md)
- [Claude Code and Codex Workflow](./workflows/claude-code.md)

## Configure agents

Set OpenCode server defaults in the Web UI (Settings > Agents), use the setup wizard, or edit `config.json` directly. See [Configuration: Agents](./configuration/agents.md).
