# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 2025

## Overview

Perry is an open-source tool for creating isolated Docker-in-Docker development environments. This privacy policy covers the Perry mobile application.

## Data Collection

**Perry does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.**

The Perry mobile app:
- Connects only to your self-hosted Perry agent on your local network or via Tailscale
- Does not include any analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- Does not require user accounts or authentication with external services
- Stores configuration locally on your device only

## Local Network Access

Perry requires local network access to communicate with your Perry agent. This connection stays within your network and is used solely to:
- List and manage your development workspaces
- Start and stop workspace containers
- View workspace sessions and logs

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally:
- **On your device:** App preferences and agent connection settings
- **On your Perry agent:** Workspace configurations and state (self-hosted by you)

## Third-Party Services

Perry does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

## Open Source
