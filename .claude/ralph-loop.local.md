Your goal is to implement the next thing from the TODO list. Make sure that validate passes. Follow AGENTS.md guideline around tests and if tests should be added, make sure they are passing. It is of utmost important to make sure that the new features/clear features without tests are tested - especially if those are frontend interfaces. If there are no more left TODO tasks, don't pick up new work, but output <promise>COMPLETED</promise>. You are allowed to add follow up tasks to todo if they are in line with the vision in DESIGN.md and requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md. You don't need to put them in considerations unless they are very risky or confusing. Getting thing done is much more important than getting thing perfect. It doesn't matter if you deem a task low priority. If it's in TODOs it must be completed. Similarly it doesn't matter if the task requires infrastructure setup - if it's in TODO - it must be done. If you feel it's too big to do, you have to break it down and update TODOs, but do not mark the loop as COMPLETED yet. Follow the plan and make sure we aim for the vision outlined in DESIGN.md. If significant issues occurred, document how to deal with that in AGENTS.md, but keep it succinct. After your changes are confirmed, commit them, but don't push
