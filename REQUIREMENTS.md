On web, sessions never load and have a shimmer. It's confusing experience and would benefit from frontend-design skill improvements. I think the problem is that I already have like 200 sessions for some reason, or so it displays and loading took a very very long time. most of them if i click in have a few empty bubbles. We should fix that and we should make the actual sessions full screen once you click into them (like full body of the website).
The margins on the bodies are too big, we should take up more space - this may be specific to sessions
The credentials passing is a little bit weird - I think we should figure out if, for claude code, can we just pass the setup token and now have to have this weird ~/.claude pathing thing there.
We need codex to work for subscription users - try to make that work. For opencode we only want to have Zen working for now so don't worry too much about that.
I still can't write in a web terminal if I go to a workspace. Investigate that and ideally test that.
I'd like to have a mobile app in react native. Let's scaffold that and start working on a parity between web and mobile - settings, workspaces and sessions. We should make sure that the parity goal is visible inside AGENTS.md

For the mobile app - make sure we have a way to e2e test the app.
