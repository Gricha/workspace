# Developer Feedback

- The workspaces page shows cards instead of table
- When you click into a workspace you'll see a details instead of dropping you into either sessions/terminal. I'd prefer being dropped in sessions and having some sort of button
- The settings that have ability to delete and all/or stop should just be a tab at the end.
- Deleting a workspace should require a confirmation.
- Inside a single chat with CC - the line on the side (vertical lines) are misaligned and not needed. Delete them. The agent doesn't need to have an icon, and it's text doesn't need to be in a bubble, visually it can be straight up on the background. the tool calls can stay in bubbles, and so does my messages to it. I don't need an icon either.
- The chat box doesn't go all the way to the bottom of the screen.
- If I try to start an OpenCode session I just see "Agent Terminal" without actual terminal. I would love for this to match the experience of Claude Code - chat/terminal options. Frankly same for codex. These could be hard and may need to be researched.
- There should be a common layout for the pages. The width of sections in env vars/coding agents/credential files are all different
- If I try to go back to a session I'll still see the empty bubbles everywhere. I can go back to a conversation and try to resume it and see No conversation found with session ID: 9b3c483c-7917-47e0-ac5c-9ce25863af9d so i think we may be having ghost in the machine. This needs to be extensively researched. I would like to be able to pick up older sessions and see the actual messages be done. How can we do it? MOre so we will want this interface to be shared between other coding tools.
