On web, sessions never load and have a shimmer. It's confusing experience and would benefit from frontend-design skill improvements. I think the problem is that I already have like 200 sessions for some reason, or so it displays and loading took a very very long time. most of them if i click in have a few empty bubbles. We should fix that and we should make the actual sessions full screen once you click into them (like full body of the website).
I'd like to have a mobile app in react native. Let's scaffold that and start working on a parity between web and mobile - settings, workspaces and sessions. We should make sure that the parity goal is visible inside AGENTS.md
For the mobile app - make sure we have a way to e2e test the app.
